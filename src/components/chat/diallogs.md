// the intro part

// Me, and the person how is coming
// recommendations:
// don't try to pretend that the chat is a human
// be funny, simulate like the bot is writing you to make him more humanable

// I can say i passionate about tarzan chartecr and build a hole brand on it
// For example The bot cand say something like, Next time you Chris in real life tell him that
// Tarzan has send you, and you will receive a prize [And then it will show a list of event
// where i Will be based on facebook or meetup or whatever] [When they meet me in real life
// i will gave them a custom based sticker of tarzan or something like that, i would prefer
// a lego but whatever will see]
// and also you can challenge him to see how much he intercated with your contect can answer
// some question and he will receive a tarzan lego figurine, or lego figurine and i will costumize
// into lego figurine

// Alternative 1:
// Construct personas, find their common interests and decide on a dialog
// Alternative 2:
// Detect where people are caming from, for example if they click from linkedin, is moast
// propably a rectutier
// But if the came from medium ther may a software developer and we cand talk about product
// development

// time to responsd in seconds
const instant = 10; // max
const thinking = 30; // min
const longer_break = 60*60; // min maybe he went for a coffee
const cathing_up = 60*60*24*3;// 3 days min

const dialogs = [];
