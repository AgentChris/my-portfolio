## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to build a comprehensive chat bot, that will gather information about people who want to contact me, also they can see what i am working on and can make an idea about what I am interested.
 
## Decision

The chat bot should be able to talk about my field of expertise, like article on product development, personal development, and technical knowledge.

## Consequences

Build these ui interaction dialogs (flows):
- [ ] The intro flow (like hello, multiple versions)
- [ ] Ask about their field of expertise and if they have some question, I can recommend some articles that i've find meaningfully or i've wrote (the proffered way)
- [ ] Ask about personal development subjects like books, anime, tarzan charcther,tv series(picky blinder, khalisey and whatever) personalities videos that inspire you, other hobbies like skying, league of legends, beautiful ui interface and art
